# PyBank_PyPoll

PyBank:

The code for PyBank reads the budget_data.csv file and will calculate several values. It should calculate:
1) The total number of months in the dataset

2) The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

3) The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes

4) The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

5) The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

I found the "None" logic on Google. 
I found the write.file logic on chatGPT.

PyPoll: 

The code for PyPoll reads the election_data.csv file to calculate data for an election poll. The code should calculate:

1) The total number of votes cast

2) A complete list of candidates who received votes

3) The percentage of votes each candidate won

4) The total number of votes each candidate won

5) The winner of the election based on popular vote

I used Google to find the "None" logic and chatGPT to find the write.file logic to export my code to a text file.
